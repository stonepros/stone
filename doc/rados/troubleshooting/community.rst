 The Stone Community
====================

The Stone community is an excellent source of information and help. For
operational issues with Stone releases we recommend you `subscribe to the
stone-users email list`_. When you no longer want to receive emails, you can
`unsubscribe from the stone-users email list`_.

You may also `subscribe to the stone-devel email list`_. You should do so if
your issue is:

- Likely related to a bug
- Related to a development release package
- Related to a development testing package
- Related to your own builds

If you no longer want to receive emails from the ``stone-devel`` email list, you
may `unsubscribe from the stone-devel email list`_.

.. tip:: The Stone community is growing rapidly, and community members can help
   you if you provide them with detailed information about your problem. You
   can attach the output of the ``stone report`` command to help people understand your issues.
