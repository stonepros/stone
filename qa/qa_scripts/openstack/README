This directory contains scripts to quickly bring up an OpenStack instance,
attach a stone cluster, create a nova compute node, and store the associated glance images, cinder volumes, nova vm, and cinder backup on stone via rbd.

execs is a directory that contains executables that are copied and remotely
run on the OpenStack instance

files is a directory that contains templates used to initialize OpenStack
conf files.  These templates reflect the state of these conf files on 5/17/2016.
If further development is necessary in the future, these templates should
probably be removed and direct editing of the OpenStack conf files should
probably be performed.

These scripts also assume that either there is a rhel iso file named
rhel-server-7.2-x86_64-boot.iso in the user's home directory, or the
exported variable RHEL_ISO is set to point at an existing rhel iso file.
If one is also running the stone-deploy based stone_install.sh, this script
also assumes that there is a file named rhstone-1.3.1-rhel-7-x86_64-dvd.iso
in the files directory.  These iso files can be obtained from the rhel site
and are not stored with these scripts.

To install openstack:
./openstack.sh <openstack-admin-node> <stone-monitor-node>

This assumes that the stone cluster is already set up.

To setup a stone-cluster using an iso and stone-deploy:
./stone_install.sh <admin-node> <mon-node> <osd-node> <osd-node> <osd-node>

To setup a stone-cluster using the cdn and stone-ansible:
cd stone_install_w_ansible
./stone_install.sh <admin-node> <mon-node> <osd-node> <osd-node> <osd-node>
